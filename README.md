# find-blank-space

we have a db table with one column that include clientnumber. (ther isn't any id column and we cant add another column to this table)
the probleam is that we need put new client in first blank space and give first minimum number to that. (notice: vip client can refer a number as client number)
- we need to find blank space
- we need to calculate first minimum client number
